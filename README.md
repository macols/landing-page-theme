are broken down into four main categories: Read, Watch, Try, and What's New.

### Read

Create a solid foundation by hitting the books with Service Fabric's official documentation, team blog, and roadmap. 

### Watch

There are plenty of videos out there about Service Fabric. Checkout Microsoft Virtual Academy videos to get a breadth perspective of the platform. YouTube channels
dive deep into specific subject matter. 

### Try
